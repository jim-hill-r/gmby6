- Leaders: Want to give back to the community? Are you setting routes that nobody knows about? Let Gumby know and we can spread the word. Become a leader in the community!

### Community growth - Be a hero!

With the rapid growth of climbing, Gumby is passionate about ensuring climbing remains about the rock and nature! We are a community of heroes that give back to our rock climbing and those who maintain it!

- Stewardship: It is up to our community to ensure crags and gyms are places to be maintained and protected.
- Safety: Bolts and gear need replacement and new climbers need mentorship.
- Mentorship: Looking for experienced climbers to help!
